# Greed
Move around the bottom of the screen to try and collect the gems (*) and avoid the rocks (o) if you catch a gem you earn one point, but if you get it by a rock you lose a point. Be careful you can go into the negative. You will be playing in zen mode. Continue playing until you close the game.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3 rfk 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure

```
